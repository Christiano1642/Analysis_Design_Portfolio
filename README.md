# Project Reflection

## Problem Solved

The projects in this course focused on developing and implementing data structures, particularly hash tables and course planning systems. The primary problem was to create efficient data management and retrieval systems to handle bids and course prerequisites.

## Approach to the Problem

Understanding data structures is crucial because they form the backbone of efficient algorithm implementation. For the hash table project, I designed a hash table with chaining to manage bid data. This approach ensures fast data insertion, deletion, and search operations. For the course planner project, I used a map to store and retrieve course details, ensuring the data structure was both efficient and intuitive.

## Overcoming Roadblocks

Throughout these projects, I encountered several challenges, such as implementing the hash function, managing collisions in the hash table, and ensuring the correct parsing and storage of data from CSV files. To overcome these roadblocks, I broke down each problem into smaller, manageable tasks and utilized debugging tools and print statements to trace and fix errors. Seeking help from forums and documentation also proved invaluable.

## Expanding Software Design Approach

Working on these projects has significantly broadened my approach to software design and development. I've learned the importance of selecting the right data structure for a specific problem to optimize performance and memory usage. The projects underscored the necessity of thinking about potential edge cases and planning for them in the design phase.

## Evolving Programming Practices

These projects have refined my programming practices to focus more on writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. I've adopted better naming conventions, modularized my code, and added comments for clarity. Additionally, I've learned to write code that can be easily extended or modified, ensuring future changes can be made with minimal disruption.
